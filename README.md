Now a few words.
First of all I want to clarify that I'm not a programmer, I'm just an enthusiast who wants to do things and is always looking for a way to do them.

The source codes inside the software you find here may not be the most optimized, may contain redundancies and not always the best solutions, so feel free to contribute to improve them. All ideas and suggestions are welcome.  All ideas and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

Have a nice day :)
