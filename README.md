# Arduino-Hardware-Monitor
Disclaimer: If you decide to try any of these programs do it under your own risk and check the code before executing it.


Here you will find the software I have developed to monitor the PC hardware from the Arduino through the serial port.

There are only a small number of files:

The C# program : Program.cs
The Arduino program : Serial_TO_Screen.ino
The library : OpenHardwareMonitorLib.dll

The library can also be obtained from their official website, by downloading and installing the Open Hardware Monitor software from this URL: https://openhardwaremonitor.org/downloads/


Now a few extra words.
First of all I want to clarify that I'm not a programmer, I'm just an enthusiast who wants to do things and is always looking for a way to do them.

The source codes inside the software you find here may not be the most optimized, may contain redundancies and not always the best solutions, so feel free to contribute to improve them. All ideas and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

Please note that English is not my main language, therefore you may find errors in the wording and grammar both in this message and within the comments in the software code.

Have a nice day :)
